 Advent-of-Code-Data Example Parser
 ==================================
 
 The annual programming challenge [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) frequently provides some example data (and solutions) for you to test your code against, which are usually scaled-down versions of the real input data you're supposed to be solving with each day.
 
 Although the real puzzle inputs and answers differ by user, the example data is written directly in the puzzle prose and is available to unauthenticated users too.
 
-To illustrate what this means, the first puzzle of 2022 was [--- Day 1: Calorie Counting ---

The example data text was found in the first `<pre>` tag, and the answers were found in the last `<code>` blocks from each of the two `<article>` sections in the puzzle page HTML. Note that the first half of the puzzle must be solved before the second `<article>` tag shows up, so the second article is not visible to unauthenticated users.

 There are so many creative and smart people hacking on AoC that I'm sure several of you can come up with something much better than I was able to!
 The default implementation from `aocd` fails more than 40% of the time, so you don't have a very high bar to beat.

 But difficulty aside, the main reason is that you needn't "overfit" to previous puzzles.
