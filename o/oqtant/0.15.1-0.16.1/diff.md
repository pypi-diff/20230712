 # Walkthrough Notebooks
 
-Getting started with Oqtant is easy using the walkthrough notebooks (your Oqtant installation already includes the latest version of Jupyter Notebook). These walkthroughs will walk you through the basic functions of using Oqtant to interact with the Oqtant hardware. Feel free to use these as a starting point for your own code: edit, rename, shareâ€¦ they are yours.

 If you run into `ModuleNotFound` errors when running cells within the notebooks it can be a sign that the notebooks are not using the correct version of python. To fix this close the notebook server, run the following, then restart the notebooks:
 
 ```
 python -m ipykernel install --user
 ```
 
 **Note: You may notice that each walkthrough notebook has two files with different extensions (.ipynb and .md). The files you want to be using with Jupyter are the .ipynb files as these are what runs the underlying Oqtant python code. The .md files are static markdown representations of the walkthrough notebooks that can be used as reference if needed. The .md files are safe to delete**

+To easily reference OqtantJobs from the current or previous sessions it is useful to write their ids to a file named after the job. This file can be used later to access the OqtantJob.
+
+In this case we are saving this OqtantJob's id under a file named after this walkthrough.
 
 ```python
-with open('example_barrier_job-walkthrough1.txt', 'w') as f:
-    f.write(example_barrier_job_uuid)

+There may be times where you would like to create a new OqtantJob based off of a previous one. In these cases the OqtantClient class provides a method that retrieves an entire OqtantJob's input structure to allow for editing and submission. The steps to do this can be found below.
 
 ```python
 # identify the job you wish to copy, this can be any job id you want to use.
 # the status of the job does not matter
-already_submitted_job_id = example_barrier_job.external_id
+already_submitted_job_id = barrier_manipulator_job.external_id
 
 # for jobs with multiple input runs add `run=<int>` where <int> equals the input you wish to view.
 # without a targeted input run oqtant will default to the first run
-new_job_stub = oqtant_client.get_job_inputs_without_output(already_submitted_job_id, include_notes=False)
+new_barrier_manipulator_job_stub = oqtant_client.get_job_inputs_without_output(already_submitted_job_id, include_notes=False)
 
 # at this point 'new_job_stub' is a python dict with the following keys
-print("new job stub keys:")
-print(new_job_stub.keys())
+print("new barrier manipulator job stub keys:")
+print(new_barrier_manipulator_job_stub.keys())
 print("\n")
 
 # if you wish to include any job notes associated with the existing job input you can run the
 # same command above but with the `include_notes` flag set to True
 # new_job_stub = oqtant_client.get_job_inputs_without_output(already_submitted_job_id, include_notes=True)
 
 # from here you can update any of the inputs and the name of the job to your liking
-new_job_stub["name"] = "this is a stub of another job"
+new_barrier_manipulator_job_stub["name"] = "this is a stub of another job"
 
 # at this point 'new_job_stub' can be provided to the 'generate_octant_job' function and then submitted with
 # the 'run_jobs' function as demonstrated in previous steps
-new_example_barrier_job = oqtant_client.generate_oqtant_job(job=new_job_stub)
-print("new job object:")
-print(new_example_barrier_job)
+new_barrier_manipulator_job = oqtant_client.generate_oqtant_job(job=new_barrier_manipulator_job_stub)
+print("new barrier manipulator job object:")
+print(new_barrier_manipulator_job)
 ```
+
+## View your current job limits
+
+Your account provides you with a limited number of jobs which you can run in a given period of time. You can check your limits and current status against those limits via the `OqtantClient.get_limits()` method:
+
+```python
+limits = oqtant_client.get_job_limits()
+print(limits)
+```
+
+If you are running batch jobs, each run is counted as a job against your limit (i.e., a batch job with 10 runs counts as 10 against your limits).

At the next level of complexity, Barrier Manipulator jobs support both _rf_evaporation_ and _optical_barriers_ but not "optical_landscape" or "lasers". What data structures are supported by different job types will become clear as those job types are created/used/submitted. As a preview, please refer to the following table.

 ## The RfEvaporation Object
 
-Every job input has exactly one constituent RfEvaporation object defined by the "rf_evaporation" data shown above.  The behavior of this object controls the RF knife evaporation from an ultracold gas to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), as well as providing flexibility for applying RF fields during the experiment phase after the initial evaporation is complete.  The evaporation stage results in a tradeoff between final atom number and temperature -- evaporating more deeply, signified by RF detuning values closer to 0, produces less atoms but at colder temperature (and correspondingly higher condensate fraction).  Applying RF radiation during the experiment phase allows for hot atoms above some temperature, produced for example by rapid manipulation of optical barries or landscape potentials (explored below), to be removed the experiment -- a so-called "RF shield".

-It is important to note here that we adopt the convention that time = 0 refers to the *end* of the evaporation period.  As such, the initial evaporation to BEC, as defined by the object under current inspection, will involve negative (relative) times.  In our trap, the entire evaporation cycle takes on the order of a second, and times are specified in ms, so we should see negative times as large as a few thousand ms.

 ### Construction
 
-Let us begin by constructing a stand-alone RfEvaporation object completely independently of any specific Oqtant job.  We can create this object by either calling the constructor directly with the required data fields:

         interpolation = "LINEAR"
 )
 ```
 
 or by placing the underlying data in a dictionary and unpacking that dictionary in order to pass it to the constructor:
 
-
 ```python
 evap = JobSchema.RfEvaporation(**{
         "times_ms": [-1600, -1200, -800, -400, 0],

         "interpolation": "LINEAR"
 })
 ```
 
-Inherent to the RfEvaporation object are three lists, *times_ms*, *frequencies_mhz*, and *powers_mw*.  The key prefix corresponds to the parameter being controlled, while the suffix refers to the associated units.  In this case, we specify a list of times in milliseconds (ms), frequencies in MHz (mhz), and powers in milliwatts (mw).  Note that all units are lower case, which can cause confusion if taken out of context.  All three lists must share the same length as each time element is paired with the corresponding element of the frequencies/powers list(s).  The specified behavior of the RF evaporation stage defind by the above data is as follows: At -1.6 seconds the RF power is set at 500 mW and the frequency (detuning) at 17 MHz.  By the end of the evaporation period, defined by t=0, the frequency/detuning has decreased to 0.045 MHz = 45 kHz and the power has been reduced to 220 mW.  Intermediate values of frequency and power are adopted between those two points in time, with the full time dependence being a result of the given data and chosen interpolation type, which controls how the RF fields behave between the given data points.

-Frequencies are given as a detuning with respect to the energetic trap bottom, so RF fields at a frequency/detuning of 0 would eliminate all atoms from the trap.  Achieving final BEC temperatures on the order of 100 nK usually corresponds to final RF frequencies of a few tens of kHz.  Powers refer to the amount of power delivered to an antenna that bathes the ultracold atoms with RF radiation.  The actual local RF field experienced by the atoms depends on system losses and the exact geometry of the antenna.

 ### Time-dependent evaporation parameters
 
-We can explore the time-dependence of the RFEvaporation object frequency and power, as defined by the data structure above, using some useful functions included with oqtant.  For example, we can query the object for the instantaneous power or frequency at any point in time.  Recall that the units of power are mW and the units of frequency are MHz.

-
 ```python
 print(evap.get_power(time = 100))           # request after last defined object time of 0 ms -> 0.0
 print(evap.get_frequency(time = -1800))     # request before first defined object time of -1600 ms -> 0.0
 ```
 
-This behavior is generic to most objects in oqtant -- any temporal or spatial extrapolation requests yield 0.0.

 ## Barrier Objects

-
 ### Construction
 
-First, let us demonstrate the construction of a Barrier object, which represents a one-dimensional optical potential barrier to the BEC.  A barrier is characterized by a shape, a time-dependent position, height, and width, and information on how to interpolate over the underlying data in time.  For example, let us construct a Barrier object named *barr* for which the center scans from 1-11 microns in the first 10 ms of an experiment.  Over this same time period, the barrier height will increase from 1 kHz to 11 kHz.  The width will remain constant at 1 micron throughout, as will the (fixed) Gaussian shape.  In this case, the width parameter corresponds to the Gaussian width of the barrier.

In an actual experiment, the barrier positions are updated every 100 microseconds, so the time-dependent barrier parameters will only approximately follow the idealized interpolated line.

 ### Exploring Barrier shape options
 
-Supported Barrier shape options include GAUSSIAN, SQUARE, and LORENTZIAN.  In all three cases, the "width_um" parameter list means something slightly different.  For the GAUSSIAN case, the functional form of the barrier potential $U(x)$ follows the standard Gaussian formula

 ### Exploring Barrier interpolation options
 
-A Barrier object's 'interpolation' style determines how the time-dependent position, height, and width are determined for intermediate times between the provided data points in the 'times_ms' list class member. At this time, the interpolation choice is *shared* for all three time-dependent barrier parameters.  Let us explore the effects of different interpolation choices by altering the time-dependent position of our barrier, to make it a little more interesting, and then plot the position over time for a few different interpolation choices.

Other interpolation options, like 'SMOOTH' (which is functionally equivalent to 'CUBIC'), give rise to a continually varying barrier position (and height/width).  The full list of interpolation options is as follows:

 ## The Optical Landscape Object
 
-Another Oqtant job primitive is the (singular) 'OpticalLandscape' object.  This construct is similar to the optical barriers list in the sense that it instructs the experiment to apply 1D optical potentials, in the form of painted blue-detuned light, to the condensate over the course of the experiment.  However, now the user (you!) is free to specify a list of positions and corresponding potential energies at specified times, instead of being limited to the concept of a singular barrier or combination of multiple barriers.

 ### Understanding the time dependence of the composed OpticalLandscape object
 
-The time-dependence of the overall optical potential-energy landscape, as derived from the individual *landscapes[]* list, is somewhat complicated.  As for *Barrier* and other similar objects, any temporal extrapolation (behavior for data outside the defined time period, i.e. before the first or after the last elements of the *landscapes[]* list) results in zero potential  (in the absence of any other sources, such as Barriers).  Therefore, the only way to get a non-zero painted potential optical landscape is to define at least two landscapes that can be interpolated between.  To hold a static (unchanging) potential during a period of the experiment, one would define two elements of the *landscapes[]* list with identical potential energy profiles but differing times, with the potential being applied between those two times.  If one desires the potential to change dynamically, then adjacent elements of the *landscapes[]* list (elements with the nearest *time_ms* values) should define the snapshots of the desired potential at the temporal endpoints.  In between these endpoints the potential landscape is interpolated point-by-point (in position) according to the user-specified value for *interpolation*.  This process continues so that, at the specified times of the elements of *landscapes[]*, the overall optical potential energy landscape instantaneously equal to those individual landscapes.  
-
-In our example above, with linear interpolation, this means that there will be a period of no optical potential between 0 and 1 ms, our *landscape_1* potential will start being applied at 1 ms, this potential will smoothly (linearly, in this case) morph into the *landscape_2* potential between 1 and 10 ms, and then this potential landscape will be held until the end of the experiment.  Let us use oqtant's visualization functions to inspect this behavior to make it clear.

As for _Barrier_ and other similar objects, any temporal extrapolation (behavior for data outside the defined time period, i.e. before the first or after the last elements of the _landscapes[]_ list) results in zero potential (in the absence of any other sources, such as Barriers). Therefore, the only way to get a non-zero painted potential optical landscape is to define at least two landscapes that can be interpolated between. To hold a static (unchanging) potential during a period of the experiment, one would define two elements of the _landscapes[]_ list with identical potential energy profiles but differing times, with the potential being applied between those two times. If one desires the potential to change dynamically, then adjacent elements of the _landscapes[]_ list (elements with the nearest _time_ms_ values) should define the snapshots of the desired potential at the temporal endpoints. In between these endpoints the potential landscape is interpolated point-by-point (in position) according to the user-specified value for _interpolation_. This process continues so that, at the specified times of the elements of _landscapes[]_, the overall optical potential energy landscape instantaneously equal to those individual landscapes.
 
+In our example above, with linear interpolation, this means that there will be a period of no optical potential between 0 and 1 ms, our _landscape_1_ potential will start being applied at 1 ms, this potential will smoothly (linearly, in this case) morph into the _landscape_2_ potential between 1 and 10 ms, and then this potential landscape will be held until the end of the experiment. Let us use oqtant's visualization functions to inspect this behavior to make it clear.
 
 ```python
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 0.9)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 1)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 3)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 5)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 7)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 9)
 optical_landscape.plot_potential(time = 11)
 ```
 
-As descibed above, we can see zero overall potential both before the first and after the last times of the individual Landscape objects.  At 1 ms, the first Landscape is assumed.  The potential landscape then morphs into our second Landscape object at t = 10 ms.

 ### Construction
 
-Let us begin by constructing a *Laser* object, which gives the user control over near-resonant laser light applied to the atoms over the course of the experiment.  This differs from the painted potential laser, which is far off-resonance in order to apply potential energy landscapes and barriers to the trapped condensate.  Resonant or near-resonant light, on the other hand, results in scattering of photons from the light field by the atoms.  This is useful, for example, in TRANSISTOR jobs where we want to remove atoms from some spatial region of the trap using a so-called TERMINATOR laser.
